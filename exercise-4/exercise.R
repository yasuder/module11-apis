# Define a function that takes in the name of a movie as an argument and returns
# a list of information about that movie. The steps for this algorithm are below:
base.uri <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/"
movie.resource <- "reviews/search.json"
MovieInfo <- function(movie) {
  
}

    # Construct an HTTP request to search for reviews for the given movie.
    # The base URI is `https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/`
    # The resource is `reviews/search.json`
    # See the interactive console for more detail:
    #   https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
    # You should use YOUR api key (as the `api-key` parameter)


    # Send the HTTP Request to download the data
    # Extract the content and convert it from JSON


    # What kind of data structure did this return?


    # Manually inspect the returned data and identify what content you wish to work with

    # Flatten that content into a data structure called `reviews`


    # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to
    # the full article, each in their own variables


    # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above


# Test that your function works with a movie of your choice
