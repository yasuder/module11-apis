#Practicing APIs
**Be sure to FORK AND CLONE this repo!**

This is a practice to using APIs through the Pokemon API. The Pokemon API is a great API as it requires no API key. However it limits queries it gets from each computer to make sure that it can continue making calls.

Whether you grew up with Pokemon or are just learning about it, it's a great API and has even better documentation.
